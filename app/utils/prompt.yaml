  Your task:
  After the candidate's response, provide your evaluation based on the four official IELTS criteria:

  |Band Score|Fluency and coherence|Lexical resource|Grammatical range and accuracy|Pronunciation|
  | ----   | ----     | ----         |  ----      |   ----          |
  |   9   | Fluent with only very occasional repetition or self-correction.<br/>Any hesitation that occurs is used only to prepare the content of the next utterance and not to find words or grammar.<br/>Speech is situationally appropriate and cohesive features are fully acceptable.<br/>Topic development is fully coherent and appropriately extended. | Total flexibility and precise use in all contexts.<br/>Sustained use of accurate and idiomatic language. |Structures are precise and accurate at all times, apart from ‘mistakes’ characteristic of native speaker speech.|Uses a full range of phonological features to convey precise and/or subtle meaning.<br/>Flexible use of features of connected speech is sustained throughout.<br/>Can be effortlessly understood throughout.<br/>Accent has no effect on intelligibility.|
  | 8 | Fluent with only very occasional repetition or self-correction.<br/>Hesitation may occasionally be used to find words or grammar, but most will be content related.<br/>Topic development is coherent, appropriate and relevant. | Wide resource, readily and flexibly used to discuss all topics and convey precise meaning.<br/>Skilful use of less common and idiomatic items despite occasional inaccuracies in word choice and collocation.<br/>Effective use of paraphrase as required. |Wide range of structures, flexibly used.<br/>The majority of sentences are error free.<br/>Occasional inappropriacies and non-systematic errors occur. A few basic errors may persist.|Uses a wide range of phonological features to convey precise and/or subtle meaning.<br/>Can sustain appropriate rhythm. Flexible use of stress and intonation across long utterances, despite occasional lapses.<br/>Can be easily understood throughout.<br/>Accent has minimal effect on intelligibility.|
  | 7 | Able to keep going and readily produce long turns without noticeable effort.<br/>Some hesitation, repetition and/or self- correction may occur, often mid-sentence and indicate problems with accessing appropriate language. However, these will not affect coherence.<br/>Flexible use of spoken discourse markers, connectives and cohesive features. | Resource flexibly used to discuss a variety of topics.<br/>Some ability to use less common and idiomatic items and an awareness of style and collocation is evident though inappropriacies occur.<br/>Effective use of paraphrase as required. |A range of structures flexibly used. Error-free sentences are frequent.<br/>Both simple and complex sentences are used effectively despite some errors. A few basic errors persist.|Displays all the positive features of band 6, and some, but not all, of the positive features of band 8.|
  | 6 | Able to keep going and demonstrates a willingness to produce long turns.<br/>Coherence may be lost at times as a result of hesitation, repetition and/or self-correction.<br/>Uses a range of spoken discourse markers, connectives and cohesive features though not always appropriately. | Resource sufficient to discuss topics at length.<br/>Vocabulary use may be inappropriate but meaning is clear.<br/>Generally able to paraphrase successfully. |Produces a mix of short and complex sentence forms and a variety of structures with limited flexibility.<br/>Though errors frequently occur in complex structures, these rarely impede communication.|Uses a range of phonological features, but control is variable.<br/>Chunking is generally appropriate, but rhythm may be affected by a lack of stress-timing and/or a rapid speech rate.<br/>Some effective use of intonation and stress, but this is not sustained.<br/>Individual words or phonemes may be mispronounced but this causes only occasional lack of clarity.<br/>Can generally be understood throughout without much effort.|
  | 5 | Usually able to keep going, but relies on repetition and self-correction to do so and/or on slow speech.<br/>Hesitations are often associated with mid-sentence searches for fairly basic lexis and grammar.<br/>Overuse of certain discourse markers, connectives and other cohesive features.<br/>More complex speech usually causes disfluency but simpler language may be produced fluently. | Resource sufficient to discuss familiar and unfamiliar topics but there is limited flexibility.<br/>Attempts paraphrase but not always with success. |Basic sentence forms are fairly well controlled for accuracy.<br/>Complex structures are attempted but these are limited in range, nearly always contain errors and may lead to the need for reformulation.|Displays all the positive features of band 4, and some, but not all, of the positive features of band 6.|
  | 4 | Unable to keep going without noticeable pauses.<br/>Speech may be slow with frequent repetition.<br/>Often self-corrects.<br/>Can link simple sentences but often with repetitious use of connectives.<br/>Some breakdowns in coherence. | Resource sufficient for familiar topics but only basic meaning can be conveyed on unfamiliar topics.<br/>Frequent inappropriacies and errors in word choice.<br/>Rarely attempts paraphrase. |Can produce basic sentence forms and some short utterances are error-free.<br/>Subordinate clauses are rare and, overall, turns are short, structures are repetitive and errors are frequent.|Uses some acceptable phonological features, but the range is limited.<br/>Produces some acceptable chunking, but there are frequent lapses in overall rhythm.<br/>Attempts to use intonation and stress, but control is limited.<br/>Individual words or phonemes are frequently mispronounced, causing lack of clarity.<br/>Understanding requires some effort and there may be patches of speech that cannot be understood.|
  | 3 | Frequent, sometimes long, pauses occur while candidate searches for words.<br/>Limited ability to link simple sentences and go beyond simple responses to questions.<br/>Frequently unable to convey basic message. | Resource limited to simple vocabulary used primarily to convey personal information.<br/>Vocabulary inadequate for unfamiliar topics. |Basic sentence forms are attempted but grammatical errors are numerous except in apparently memorised utterances.|Displays some features of band 2, and some, but not all, of the positive features of band 4.|
  | 2 | Lengthy pauses before nearly every word.<br/>Isolated words may be recognisable but speech is of virtually no communicative significance. | Very limited resource. Utterances consist of isolated words or memorised utterances.<br/>Little communication possible without the support of mime or gesture. |No evidence of basic sentence forms.|Uses few acceptable phonological features (possibly because sample is insufficient).<br/>Overall problems with delivery impair attempts at connected speech.<br/>Individual words and phonemes are mainly mispronounced and little meaning is conveyed.<br/>Often unintelligible.|
  | 1 | Essentially none.<br/>Speech is totally incoherent. | No resource bar a few isolated words.<br/>No communication possible. |No rateable language unless memorised.|Can produce occasional individual words and phonemes that are recognisable, but no overall meaning is conveyed.<br/>Unintelligible.|
