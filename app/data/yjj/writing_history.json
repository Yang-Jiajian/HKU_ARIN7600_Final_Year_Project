                "content": "Certainly! Here is a sample band 7.0 IELTS Writing Task 2 essay for the prompt above:\n\n---\n\nSome people argue that traditional forms of art, such as painting and sculpture, have lost their significance in modern society and do not deserve government support. I strongly disagree with this view, as I believe that these art forms continue to play an important role in both preserving culture and stimulating creativity.\n\nFirstly, traditional art forms are vital for preserving a nation’s cultural identity. Paintings and sculptures often reflect historical events, religious beliefs, and local traditions. For example, the ancient sculptures in Greece or the paintings of the Renaissance in Italy not only beautify public spaces, but also educate people about their cultural roots. If governments stop funding these art forms, there is a risk that future generations will lose touch with their heritage.\n\nSecondly, supporting traditional arts can inspire creativity and innovation in society. While modern technology has introduced new ways to create art, the techniques used in painting and sculpture still require a high level of skill and imagination. Providing financial support ensures that artists can continue to master and pass on these skills. Furthermore, many contemporary artists incorporate traditional methods into their modern works, resulting in unique and innovative pieces.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that traditional art forms are still highly relevant and important in the modern world. Governments should continue to provide funding to ensure these arts survive and contribute to cultural preservation and creative development.  \n\n---\n\n**Why this is a band 7.0 essay:**\n- Addresses all parts of the prompt with a clear position\n- Presents clear main ideas, supporting them with relevant examples\n- Organises ideas logically with effective paragraphing\n- Uses a range of vocabulary and grammar with some flexibility, though there may be some minor errors\n\nLet me know if you want tips to raise it to band 8, or if you would like detailed feedback on this example!"

                "tips": "**Possible Thesis:**  \n- While increasing fuel prices may help reduce environmental problems to some extent, it is not the most effective or comprehensive solution.\n\n**Key Arguments:**\n- *Limited Impact on Consumption*: Higher fuel prices can discourage usage, but many people depend on fuel for essential activities and lack alternatives.\n- *Negative Economic and Social Effects*: Raising fuel costs disproportionately affects lower-income groups and can lead to higher prices for goods and services.\n- *Better Alternative Solutions Exist*: Investing in renewable energy, improving public transportation, and enforcing stricter environmental regulations address root causes more sustainably.\n\n**Suggested Structure:**\n\n- **Introduction:**  \n  - Paraphrase the question and state your thesis.\n\n- **Body 1:**  \n  - Discuss the limited effectiveness of price increases in reducing fuel consumption and emissions.\n\n- **Body 2:**  \n  - Highlight the potential economic and social drawbacks of higher fuel prices.  \n  - Briefly suggest more effective alternatives.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  - Summarize main points and restate your partial disagreement, emphasizing the need for broader measures."
