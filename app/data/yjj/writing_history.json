Here is a sample band 7.0 IELTS Writing Task 2 essay for the prompt above:\n\n---\n\nSome people argue that traditional forms of art, such as painting and sculpture, have lost their significance in modern society and do not deserve government support. I strongly disagree with this view, as I believe that these art forms continue to play an important role in both preserving culture and stimulating creativity.\n\nFirstly, traditional art forms are vital for preserving a nation’s cultural identity. Paintings and sculptures often reflect historical events, religious beliefs, and local traditions. For example, the ancient sculptures in Greece or the paintings of the Renaissance in Italy not only beautify public spaces, but also educate people about their cultural roots. If governments stop funding these art forms, there is a risk that future generations will lose touch with their heritage.\n\nSecondly, supporting traditional arts can inspire creativity and innovation in society. While modern technology has introduced new ways to create art, the techniques used in painting and sculpture still require a high level of skill and imagination. Providing financial support ensures that artists can continue to master and pass on these skills. Furthermore, many contemporary artists incorporate traditional methods into their modern works, resulting in unique and innovative pieces.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that traditional art forms are still highly relevant and important in the modern world. Governments should continue to provide funding to ensure these arts survive and contribute to cultural preservation and creative development.  \n\n---\n\n**Why this is a band 7.0 essay:**\n- Addresses all parts of the prompt with a clear position\n- Presents clear main ideas, supporting them with relevant examples\n- Organises ideas logically with effective paragraphing\n- Uses a range of vocabulary and grammar with some flexibility, though there may be some minor errors\n\nLet me know if you want tips to raise it to band 8, or if you would like detailed feedback on this example!"

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\", here are some ideas you could use:\n\n**Agree:**\n- Raising fuel prices discourages car use, leading to fewer emissions from transport.\n- Higher costs can encourage public transportation use and development.\n- More expensive fuel can motivate consumers and industries to seek alternative, cleaner energy sources—like electric cars or renewable energy.\n- Can reduce traffic congestion and associated pollution.\n\n**Disagree:**\n- Increasing fuel prices disproportionately affects the poor, making it an unfair solution.\n- People may still need to drive for work or necessity, so the change might not reduce usage as much as intended.\n- There are other, potentially more effective solutions, such as investing in renewable energy, stricter emission regulations, or promoting green technology.\n- Raising fuel costs might hurt the economy, especially industries reliant on transportation.\n\n**Balance / Alternative solutions:**\n- Combination approaches: modest fuel price increases plus subsidies for electric cars, investments in cycling infrastructure, stricter vehicle emission standards, etc.\n- Education and awareness campaigns to encourage environmentally friendly behaviour.\n- Promoting remote working to reduce commuting needs.\n\nYou can develop your position by including examples, such as countries where fuel taxes have led to environmental improvements or where alternative measures were more successful."

                "content": "I strongly disagree with the view that raising fuel prices is the best way to tackle environmental problems. While it may contribute to reducing emissions in the short term, it is neither sufficient nor equitable as a standalone solution, and more holistic, sustainable strategies are urgently needed.\n\nAdmittedly, higher fuel prices can discourage excessive consumption. When petrol and diesel become more expensive, individuals may drive less, opt for public transport, or consider fuel-efficient or electric vehicles. Similarly, businesses may seek to optimise logistics and invest in cleaner technologies to cut operational costs. In this sense, price mechanisms can act as a market-based incentive for behavioural change. Some countries, such as those in Scandinavia, have combined high fuel taxes with robust green infrastructure, resulting in measurable declines in per capita carbon emissions.\n\nHowever, relying primarily on fuel price hikes is deeply problematic. First, it disproportionately affects low- and middle-income households, for whom transport costs constitute a significant portion of their budget. A delivery driver, a nurse commuting to night shifts, or a rural family with no public transport alternatives cannot simply “choose” not to use fuel—making such a policy socially unjust. Without accompanying support (e.g., subsidies for clean alternatives or improved transit), it risks exacerbating inequality rather than solving environmental issues.\n\nMore critically, environmental challenges—such as biodiversity loss, plastic pollution, deforestation, and industrial emissions—extend far beyond fossil fuel consumption. Even if fuel use declined, unchecked agricultural runoff, coal-powered electricity, or fast fashion waste would continue degrading ecosystems. Thus, a singular focus on fuel pricing ignores the systemic nature of the crisis.\n\nA far more effective approach involves integrated policies:\n\nInvesting in affordable, reliable public transport and cycling infrastructure to provide real alternatives;\nSubsidising renewable energy and electric vehicles, especially for vulnerable communities;\nEnforcing strict regulations on industrial emissions, waste management, and land use;\nPromoting circular economies and environmental education to shift long-term values and consumption patterns.\nIn conclusion, while increasing fuel prices may play a supportive role within a broader strategy, it is neither the most ethical nor the most comprehensive solution. True environmental progress demands systemic change—prioritising equity, innovation, and sustainability over simplistic economic levers."
