                "content": "Title: Are Urban Green Spaces a Waste or a Necessity?\n\nSome people argue that allocating land and funds to public parks and green areas in cities is impractical, especially when urban land is scarce and municipal budgets are stretched. They contend that cities should prioritize housing, transport infrastructure, and commercial development, which deliver measurable economic returns and address pressing social needs. From this perspective, parks can be seen as underutilized spaces that generate limited revenue, incur ongoing maintenance costs, and sometimes attract antisocial behavior, thereby creating additional security and cleaning expenses for local authorities.\n\nHowever, others maintain that green spaces are indispensable to the quality of urban life. First, numerous studies link access to urban greenery with improved physical and mental health, reducing stress, anxiety, and cardiovascular risk. This has downstream benefits for public health systems through lower medical expenditure. Second, parks foster social cohesion: they are inclusive, low-cost venues where residents of different ages and backgrounds interact, strengthening community ties and civic identity. Third, from an environmental standpoint, green areas mitigate urban heat islands, absorb air pollutants, enhance stormwater management, and support biodiversity—functions that are increasingly vital amid climate change and extreme weather. Finally, well-designed parks can raise nearby property values and attract tourism, cultural events, and investment, indirectly contributing to the urban economy.\n\nIn my view, urban green spaces are not a luxury but a core component of livable, resilient cities. The apparent trade-off between parks and development is often a false dichotomy. With thoughtful planning—such as integrating pocket parks into dense neighborhoods, creating multi-functional green corridors, and adopting public–private partnerships for maintenance—cities can balance economic imperatives with environmental and social wellbeing. Ultimately, the long-term returns of green infrastructure, both tangible and intangible, outweigh their costs. Therefore, maintaining and strategically expanding urban parks should remain a policy priority."
