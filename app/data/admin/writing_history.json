                "content": "Title: Public Transport or New Roads?\n\nSome people say the government should spend more money on public transportation instead of building new roads. I mostly agree with this idea, but I also think new roads are still needed in some places.\n\nFirst, public transport can move many people at the same time. Buses, subways and trains can reduce traffic jams, because fewer people will drive their own cars. This also helps the environment. If more people use public transport, the city will have less air pollution and noise. In addition, tickets for buses and trains are cheaper than buying and keeping a car, so this is good for low-income people. It makes the city more equal and convenient for everyone.\n\nHowever, building new roads is still important in certain situations. In small towns or villages, there may not be enough passengers to run a good bus or train service. People still need roads to go to work, school and hospitals. Also, roads are necessary for trucks to carry goods. Without enough roads, businesses may be slower, and prices may go up.\n\nIn conclusion, government investment should focus more on public transportation, because it helps traffic, the environment and social fairness. But we should not ignore new roads, especially in rural areas and for logistics. A balanced plan is the best: improve buses and trains in cities, while building or repairing key roads where they are really needed."

By \"wider range of vocabulary,\" I mean using more varied and precise words instead of repeating the same basic terms.\n\nFor example, instead of always using \"public transport,\" you could sometimes say \"mass transit,\" \"urban rail,\" or \"commuter services.\" Instead of \"build new roads,\" you could use \"expand road infrastructure,\" \"construct highways,\" or \"upgrade road networks.\" \n\nUsing a wider vocabulary shows examiners you have better English skills and can express yourself more flexibly. Here’s an example of improving a sentence from your essay:\n\nOriginal: \"This also helps the environment.\"\nImproved: \"This also contributes to environmental sustainability.\"\n\nLet me know if you’d like more specific vocabulary suggestions for your essay!"

I'll rewrite your first body paragraph:\n\n**Your original paragraph:**  \nFirst, public transport can move many people at the same time. Buses, subways and trains can reduce traffic jams, because fewer people will drive their own cars. This also helps the environment. If more people use public transport, the city will have less air pollution and noise. In addition, tickets for buses and trains are cheaper than buying and keeping a car, so this is good for low-income people. It makes the city more equal and convenient for everyone.\n\n**Band 8 style example:**  \nFirstly, investing in mass transit systems offers a highly effective solution to urban congestion, as buses, metros, and commuter trains can accommodate large numbers of passengers simultaneously. By encouraging individuals to opt for public transportation over private vehicles, cities can significantly mitigate traffic gridlock, leading to a notable decrease in both air pollution and noise levels. Moreover, public transport is typically more affordable than owning and maintaining a personal car, making it an accessible option for people from all socioeconomic backgrounds. This not only enhances social equity but also contributes to a more sustainable and livable urban environment.\n\n**Key improvements:**\n- More varied vocabulary: \"accommodate large numbers,\" \"urban congestion,\" \"mitigate traffic gridlock,\" \"socioeconomic backgrounds,\" \"enhances social equity\"\n- More precise and academic expressions\n- Use of linking words (\"Firstly,\" \"Moreover,\" \"not only…but also\")\n- More complex sentence structures\n\nLet me know if you’d like a rewrite of another section or more vocabulary suggestions!"

                "content": "Title: AI at Work: Job Creator or Job Destroyer?\n\nThe rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the workplace has sparked a debate about its net impact on employment. While some argue that AI will expand job opportunities, others fear it will trigger widespread unemployment. In my view, AI will reshape rather than simply reduce employment, creating new roles while displacing certain tasks; the overall outcome depends on policy choices and the speed of adaptation.\n\nOn the one hand, AI is a powerful engine for productivity and innovation, which historically correlates with job creation. As routine tasks are automated, firms can reallocate resources to higher-value activities such as product design, customer experience, and new market development. This, in turn, generates demand for data analysts, AI ethicists, prompt engineers, and maintenance specialists, as well as complementary roles in cybersecurity, compliance, and training. Moreover, AI lowers barriers for entrepreneurs by cutting costs in marketing, prototyping, and operations, enabling small businesses and freelancers to compete and hire. The spread of assistive AI in healthcare and education also illustrates complementarity: clinicians and teachers can serve more people with better outcomes, often supported by new coordination and support staff.\n\nOn the other hand, the displacement effect is real and uneven. Occupations heavy in predictable, codifiable tasks—administrative support, basic accounting, and some customer service roles—are particularly vulnerable. Even knowledge workers may see task-level substitution, reducing entry-level opportunities that traditionally served as training grounds. Without proactive retraining, workers in mid-skill roles risk downward mobility. Additionally, productivity gains can be captured by a small number of firms, leading to concentration of economic power and regional inequality, which amplifies the perception of job loss.\n\nOverall, AI will neither automatically create jobs nor inevitably destroy them. The decisive factors will be workforce policies and corporate choices: investing in reskilling, supporting transitions through wage insurance and portable credentials, and encouraging human-in-the-loop designs that elevate rather than replace workers. With such measures, AI can act as a catalyst for better jobs and broader opportunity; without them, displacement could dominate. Therefore, I am cautiously optimistic, but only under an active, inclusive adaptation strategy."
