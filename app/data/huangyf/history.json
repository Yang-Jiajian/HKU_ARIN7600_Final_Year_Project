                "content": "Of course. Here is a high-scoring model answer (Band 9) for this essay question. I have included a brief analysis of *why* it scores highly.\n\n***\n\n### **Model Answer (Band 9)**\n\nThe perennial debate on crime reduction often polarises public opinion, with one camp advocating for stricter incarceration and the other for more rehabilitative approaches. While longer prison sentences offer a tangible form of justice and societal protection, I am convinced that alternative strategies focusing on prevention and rehabilitation are fundamentally more effective in creating a safer society.\n\nProponents of lengthier prison terms base their arguments on two primary pillars: deterrence and incapacitation. The theory of deterrence posits that the fear of a severe and lengthy punishment will dissuade potential offenders from committing illegal acts. For instance, the threat of a mandatory ten-year sentence for armed robbery is intended to outweigh the potential gains of the crime. Furthermore, incapacitation ensures that convicted criminals are physically removed from society, thereby preventing them from re-offending for the duration of their sentence. This offers the public a direct and immediate sense of security.\n\nHowever, the limitations of this punitive approach are significant. Criminological studies often question the effectiveness of deterrence, particularly for impulsive crimes or offences committed by individuals in desperate socio-economic circumstances. More critically, long-term imprisonment can act as a 'school for crime,' where minor offenders are exposed to hardened criminals, potentially escalating their criminal tendencies. Upon release, they often face stigmatisation and a lack of employability, which increases recidivism rates.\n\nTherefore, I believe that more sustainable solutions lie in addressing the root causes of criminal behaviour. Investing in robust social services, such as quality education in deprived areas, vocational training, and mental health support, can steer at-risk individuals away from crime. Moreover, restorative justice programs, which focus on rehabilitating offenders and reconciling them with their victims and the community, have demonstrated success in reducing re-offending. For example, Nordic countries, which emphasise rehabilitation over pure punishment, consistently report lower recidivism and crime rates compared to nations relying heavily on lengthy sentences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the instinct to punish offenders with long prison sentences is understandable, it is a short-sighted solution. A more enlightened and ultimately more successful strategy involves a multifaceted approach that combines reasonable punishment with proactive investment in social welfare and rehabilitation programs to break the cycle of crime effectively.\n\n(Word Count: 342)\n\n***\n\n### **Why This is a Band 9 Answer:**\n\n*   **Task Response (TR):** It perfectly addresses all parts of the prompt. It discusses the view for longer sentences in one body paragraph and the view for other methods in the next, before giving a clear, sustained opinion.\n*   **Coherence and Cohesion (CC):** The structure is logical and easy to follow. Each paragraph has a clear central topic, and linking words/phrases (e.g., \"However,\" \"Therefore,\" \"Furthermore,\" \"In conclusion\") are used seamlessly to guide the reader.\n*   **Lexical Resource (LR):** It uses a wide range of precise, topic-specific vocabulary (e.g., *perennial debate, polarises, incarceration, rehabilitative, deterrence, incapacitation, recidivism, stigmatisation, restorative justice, multifaceted approach*).\n*   **Grammatical Range and Accuracy (GRA):** It demonstrates a variety of complex sentence structures (e.g., conditional clauses, relative clauses, participle phrases) with a high degree of accuracy.\n\n**Your next step is not to memorise this, but to analyse its structure and language.** Try writing your own version now, applying some of the techniques you see here. I will then be able to give you personalised feedback."

                "content": "The debate over whether governments should actively fund and promote public transportation to reduce car dependency touches on core issues of public policy, environmental sustainability, and individual liberty. While both perspectives offer valid points, a balanced approach that prioritizes sustainable infrastructure without eliminating personal choice is likely the most effective path forward.\n\nOn one hand, advocates for government investment in public transport argue that it serves the collective good. Private vehicles are a major contributor to urban congestion, air pollution, and carbon emissions. By making buses, trams, and trains more affordable, reliable, and accessible, governments can encourage a modal shift away from cars. For example, cities like Copenhagen and Singapore have significantly reduced car usage through high-quality, subsidized public transit combined with policies like congestion charges and limited parking. Such measures not only improve air quality and public health but also enhance social equity—low-income citizens, who may not afford cars, gain greater mobility and opportunity. From this perspective, government intervention is not a restriction on freedom but an expansion of real choices for all members of society.\n\nOn the other hand, opponents emphasize personal autonomy. They contend that individuals should be free to choose how they travel, especially in areas where public transport is impractical—such as rural or low-density regions. For many, cars offer flexibility, convenience, and safety that buses or trains cannot match, particularly for families, people with disabilities, or those working irregular hours. Critics also warn that heavy government spending on public transit could lead to inefficiency or misallocation of resources, especially if ridership remains low. Moreover, they argue that reducing car use should be achieved through incentives—not coercion—and that technological solutions (like electric or autonomous vehicles) may offer greener alternatives without limiting freedom.\n\nIn my opinion, while personal choice is important, it must be weighed against broader societal and environmental responsibilities. Unrestricted car use imposes significant external costs—congestion, pollution, road accidents, and urban sprawl—that affect everyone. Therefore, governments have a legitimate role in shaping sustainable transport systems. However, this does not mean banning cars or forcing people onto buses. Instead, policymakers should invest in high-quality, affordable public transport while also improving walking and cycling infrastructure. At the same time, they can use market-based tools—such as fuel taxes, congestion pricing, or parking fees—to reflect the true social cost of driving, allowing individuals to make informed choices.\n\nIn conclusion, the goal should not be to eliminate private vehicles but to create a transport ecosystem where sustainable options are genuinely attractive and accessible. By funding and promoting public transportation as part of a comprehensive strategy, governments can reduce car dependency while still respecting individual freedom—ultimately fostering cleaner, healthier, and more efficient cities for all."

                "content": "Of course. Building on the previous feedback, here is more specific advice to push your writing from Band 8 to Band 9.\n\n### 1. Refining Your Thesis and Opinion\nYour thesis is strong, but you can make it more incisive.\n\n*   **Instead of:** \"...a balanced approach that prioritizes sustainable infrastructure without eliminating personal choice...\"\n*   **Try:** \"While individual autonomy is a cornerstone of a free society, the profound negative externalities of car dominance necessitate proactive government intervention to make sustainable transport a viable and attractive choice for all.\"\n\nThis version is more assertive and frames the debate around the core conflict: \"individual autonomy\" vs. \"negative externalities.\"\n\n### 2. Enhancing Argumentation with Nuance and Counter-Arguments\nGo beyond stating the views; engage with their weaknesses.\n\n*   **When discussing the \"individual freedom\" view, add a counter-point:**\n    \"While critics rightly highlight the impracticality of public transport in rural areas, this argument often overlooks the fact that the vast majority of car trips occur in dense urban corridors where high-quality transit is not only feasible but vastly more efficient. Defending the freedom to drive in contexts where it actively harms the collective good—through pollution and congestion—becomes a more contentious proposition.\"\n\n*   **When discussing \"government funding,\" acknowledge a potential flaw:**\n    \"Proponents of public funding must also address concerns of inefficiency. A poorly planned, unreliable bus service is a waste of public funds and reinforces car dependency. Therefore, funding must be coupled with rigorous management and integration with other modes, like bike-share and ride-hailing, to create a seamless network.\"\n\n### 3. Strengthening Examples with Specificity and Range\nMove from naming cities to describing specific mechanisms and using varied examples.\n\n*   **Instead of:** \"Cities like Copenhagen and Singapore have significantly reduced car usage...\"\n*   **Try:** \"The success of London's Congestion Charge, which reduced traffic in the zone by 30%, demonstrates how market-based mechanisms can effectively complement public transport investment by making drivers internalize the social cost of their journey.\"\n*   **Use a different type of example:** \"Beyond megacities, consider the Swiss model, where even small towns are integrated into a national timetable, with coordinated bus and train services making 'car-free' living a practical reality across much of the country.\"\n\n### 4. Elevating Vocabulary and Collocations\nIncorporate more sophisticated, topic-specific language.\n\n*   **Instead of \"reduce car usage,\"** use: **\"curb private vehicle mileage,\" \"mitigate traffic volumes,\" \"decouple mobility from car ownership.\"**\n*   **Instead of \"improve public transport,\"** use: **\"develop a robust, multi-modal transit network,\" \"enhance the frequency and connectivity of services,\" \"subsidize operational costs to ensure affordability.\"**\n*   **Use powerful collocations:** **\"entrenched car culture,\" \"the tipping point of viability,\" \"perverse incentives,\" \"a holistic urban mobility plan.\"**\n\n### 5. Perfecting Grammar for Impact\nUse a wider range of complex structures for emphasis.\n\n*   **Inversion for emphasis:** \"Not only does a subsidized transit system benefit the environment, but it also serves as a critical tool for social inclusion.\"\n*   **Conditional structures to explore consequences:** \"Should governments fail to invest now, they risk locking in carbon-intensive infrastructure for decades to come.\"\n*   **Participle phrases for conciseness:** \"Faced with escalating climate targets, policymakers can no longer afford to be passive.\"\n\n**In summary, your essay is already excellent. To reach the next level, focus on:**\n*   **Deeper critical engagement** with the arguments.\n*   **More precise and varied examples.**\n*   **A more assertive and nuanced thesis.**\n*   **Incorporating a wider range of sophisticated, topic-specific vocabulary.**\n\nThis will make your writing not just correct, but powerfully persuasive."
